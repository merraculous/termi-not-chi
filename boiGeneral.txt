The boi stares at you
A single tear rolls down the boi's face
The boi looks sad today
The boi feels neglected
The boi giggles in hysteria
*sigh*
The boi wonders why you don't care for him
"It's ya boi..."
The boi dreams of the dream donut
OH! The boi fell asleep
The boi starts singing to himself
How nice! The boi has brought you a flower
The boi hopes to become a computer scientist one day
It seems like the boi is playing hide and seek
It seems like the boi wants some chocolate
Looks like the boi is in the corner reading
You pat the boi
Somehow the boi found a new toy
Looks like the boi became friends with a dog
The boi looks happy today
The boi seems to want to go for a walk
Today the boi has found a lucky penny
The boi is bored
The boi looks out the window
You take the boi to the park
You gave the boi a video game
It's time for the boi to got to bed
Looks like the boi is watching tv
The boi decided to bake a cake
You went shopping for the boi
